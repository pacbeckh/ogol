# Summer School Premaster Software Engineering 2015
##Compilers and Term Rewriting (August 17-21)
##Lab: Ogol


### 1. Introduction
In the Master Software Engineering the creation and understanding of working software is highly valued. For the topic of compilers we make no exception. In the summer school we will thus spend quite a lot of lab-time applying theoretical concepts and creating (parts of) working compilers. The lab will focus on the language Ogol, which is like [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCBLogo), but without side-effects (among other features). We will be working within the Eclipse IDE with Rascal, and use GitHub as a base.

### 2. Preparation
* Install and explore the meta-programming language [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org) in the [Eclipse IDE (version Luna, for RCP and RAP Developers)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/lunasr2).
* Fork the [Ogol GitHub project](https://github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/ogol) to your own account and clone it in your Eclipse workspace.
